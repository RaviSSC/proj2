- The app is a simple Message Board for wines.  I had some computer issues and some issues with my inital idea, I thought in order to meet the requirenments of the project, I would make a simple application that met the requirenments:

    Have at least 2 data entities.
    Have full-CRUD data operations somewhere within the app's features
    Before Project 4 and Project 2 I was initally confused on the relationship entities, which was the main issue i had to contend with and further my understanding about.
